# About We-Rate-Dogs Project
This Project was done in 2022.

The dataset that I worked on is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
In this project i was able to wrangle the data by gatherng the dataset needed,assessing and cleaning the data to create interesting and trustworthy analysis and visualization.
This project is very useful because we were able to determine the top 10 most tweeted breed of dog,and also find out what breed of dog is common and much more.
